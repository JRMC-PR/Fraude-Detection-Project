  - Username variation attacks → **+40 points**
- If total **≥ 75**, flag as **high risk**.
- Use **Random Forest or Logistic Regression** to classify users into risk levels.

🚀 **Best ML Techniques for Detection**:
- **Isolation Forest** for login irregularities.

Build a user profile using a combination of:

LSTMs for sequence learning.
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for behavior prediction.
Detect anomalies using:

Isolation Forest for login irregularities.
One-Class SVM for outlier detection.
Implement risk scoring:

Assign a score based on:
