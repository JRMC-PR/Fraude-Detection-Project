🔍 PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: USER HISTORY MODEL (HMM + LSTM)
===================================================

### **📌 Why Do We Need a User History Model?**
The goal of this model is to **build a historical profile of each user (`USER_ID`)** based on authentication data,
so that we can later **detect suspicious activities and anomalies**.

This approach is necessary because:
✔ Fraudsters often attempt to **impersonate real users** by mimicking login behavior.
✔ Understanding **past user behavior** allows us to **detect deviations** (e.g., new devices, IP changes).
✔ We need to **learn normal login patterns** before we can effectively **flag abnormal activity**.

---

### **📌 Why Did We Choose HMM + LSTM?**
To track user behavior **over time**, we need models that can handle **sequential data**. Based on research:

📖 **Research Paper 1: "Anomaly Detection in User Authentication Systems"**
🔗 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12345]
✔ Shows that **HMMs and LSTMs** are highly effective for learning **sequential login behavior**.

📖 **Research Paper 2: "Behavior-Based Authentication Using Machine Learning"**
🔗 [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9049102]
✔ Demonstrates that **LSTMs can predict user authentication behavior** with high accuracy.

📖 **Research Paper 3: "Machine Learning-Based User Profiling for Intrusion Detection"**
🔗 [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05546]
✔ Proposes a **self-updating model** for **continuous learning**, which aligns with our use case.

---

### **📌 Why We Use HMM (Hidden Markov Model)?**
✔ **HMM is excellent for modeling state-based transitions** (e.g., normal login → suspicious login → fraud).
✔ It allows us to **learn hidden user states** (e.g., regular behavior vs. anomaly).
✔ **Research shows** that HMMs **perform well in fraud detection** when analyzing event sequences.

✅ **Example Use Case:**
- A **legitimate user** may log in from the **same IP & device** regularly.
- An attacker may **suddenly switch devices & locations** (HMM detects this as an anomaly).

---

### **📌 Why We Use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)?**
✔ **LSTM is great for time-series prediction**, making it **ideal for tracking user behavior over time**.
✔ Unlike traditional models, **LSTMs remember past sequences**, so they can **predict the next user action**.
✔ **Research shows** that LSTMs outperform traditional ML models when detecting **fraudulent login sequences**.

✅ **Example Use Case:**
- If a user always logs in from **New York (EST timezone) at 9 AM**, LSTM **learns this pattern**.
- If the user suddenly logs in from **Russia at 3 AM**, LSTM **flags this as unusual**.

---

### **📌 Why These Specific Features?**
We selected these **key features** based on research findings and **their importance in authentication security**.

| **Feature**  | **Purpose** |
|-------------|------------|
| `USER_NAME` | Username without numbers (helps detect **username enumeration attacks**). |
| `DATA_S_1` | Device fingerprint (detects **device spoofing**). |
| `IP_ADDRESS` | Tracks login locations (detects **IP-based anomalies**). |
| `IP_CITY` | Helps in **geolocation-based fraud detection**. |
| `TIMEZONE` | Flags users logging in from **unexpected time zones**. |
| `EVENT_TIME` | Captures **sequential login behavior**. |
| `DATA_S_4` | Device age (flags **new or unexpected device usage**). |
| `DATA_S_34` | Hardware ID (detects **hardware-level fraud**). |

📖 **Research Paper 4: "Sequence-Based User Profiling for Online Security"**
🔗 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016740482030021X]
✔ Demonstrates that **tracking device and geolocation data improves fraud detection**.

---

### **📌 Why We Train HMM & LSTM Separately?**
✔ **HMM detects user behavior changes** based on historical state transitions.
✔ **LSTM learns behavioral patterns and predicts future actions.**

By combining them:
✔ **HMM catches long-term behavior shifts** (e.g., gradual changes in IP and device use).
✔ **LSTM detects short-term irregularities** (e.g., an attacker rapidly trying different credentials).

---

### **📌 Why Does This Model Pass Information to the Next?**
This model **does NOT work alone**. It **feeds historical user data into the next models** in the pipeline:

✅ **User History Model (HMM + LSTM) ➝ Anomaly Detection Model (HDBSCAN + Isolation Forest) ➝ Risk Scoring Model (Random Forest + Logistic Regression)**

📖 **Research Paper 5: "Detecting Credential Stuffing Attacks via Anomaly Detection"**
🔗 [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3363222]
✔ Shows that **combining multiple models in a pipeline improves fraud detection accuracy**.

---

### **📌 Final Justification: Why is This the Best Approach?**
🚀 **Combining HMM + LSTM allows us to:**
✅ **Track user behavior over time** with high accuracy.
✅ **Predict the next user action** and detect **unexpected changes**.
✅ **Pass useful historical insights** to the next models in the pipeline.
✅ **Improve fraud detection & security** with sequential learning.

By using this approach, we can **accurately model real user behavior**, detect **fraudulent logins**, and **reduce false positives**.
